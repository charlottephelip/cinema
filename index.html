          <h3>My Favorite movies are : </h3>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong> Le diner de Con</strong> directed by Francis Veber in 1998. This film is an eponymous play, very entertaining with endearing characters like Fran√ßois Pignon (Jacques Villeret).</li>

              <li> <strong> Les Comp√®res</strong> also directed by Francis Veber in 1983. The duo  between Pierre Richard and G√©rard Depardieu brings the viewer into each hilarious scene. It's a wonderful film, the likes of which we are no longer used to seeing.</li>

              <li> <strong> The Wolf of Wall Street</strong> written by Martin Scorcese (2013). A perfect film in all. Whether from director or lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio. It's wonderful to see this chemistry between the two which results in the best films ever made. In addition, the fact that it happened on a true story, that of Jordan Belfort, makes it all the more exciting.</li>

          <h3> Different areas of cinema</h3>
          <h4> We have gone from a realistic cinema that is sometimes pessimistic, comic, laudatory to an entertaining mystical and fantastic cinema. However, some denounce this fantastic Fica Sion of cinema and thus want to return to the basics as with tragedy or the romantic. And that's what makes the beauty of cinema, it's that there's something for everyone, all ages, all classes, in short, for everyone.</h4>

          <h3>The 7th art, but the best of all üçø </h3>
          <h4> The main purpose of cinema and to transcribe emotions through the screen based on a story that takes place in our society (except sci-fi, blockbusters...). Thus the latter puts his finger in particular on social inequalities as well as discrimination. Thanks to several successful films like Black Panther, the place of different social classes, ethnic origins etc. is highlighted. This is what makes cinema a formidable weapon in the current fight to make our voice everyone we are all equal.</h4>
